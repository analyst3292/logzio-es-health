## Logz.io Elasticsearch Health Monitor

[Docker hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/logzio/logzio-es-health/)

This container runs and monitors your elasticsearch cluster.
It ships its logs automatically to Logz.io via SSL so everything is encrypted.
The container also provides a Nagios plugin script that uses local caches from the regular monitoring routine, so you won't overload your ES cluster with unnecessary queries.

The containers monitors these values:
1. Number of initializing shards
2. Number of pending tasks
3. Description of pending tasks (name, time in queue, urgency, etc..)
4. Number of relocating shards
5. Number of unassigned shards
6. Cluster status (red, yellow, green)
7. Mapping size - entire cluster (python length of the cluster state)
8. Mapping size - per index (python length of a specific index from cluster state)
9. Cluster state version

***
## Usage (docker run)
#### Mandatory
**LOGZ_TOKEN** - Your [Logz.io App](https://app.logz.io) token, where you can find under "settings" in the web app.
**ELASTICSEARCH_ADDR** - Your elasticsearch cluster to monitor, without protocol and port. Currently supporting only HTTP, and monitoring via the RESTful endpoint at :9200

#### Optional
**INTERVAL_SECONDS** - Number of seconds to sleep between each /_cluster/health and /_cluster/pending_tasks call. Default: 30
**CLUSTERSTATE_SECONDS** - Number of seconds to sleep between each /_cluster/state call. Default: 3600 (For large clusters this is a heavy query, so be gentle with reducing this interval)

### Example
```bash
docker run -d \
  -e LOGZ_TOKEN="MYSUPERAWESOMELOGZIOTOKEN" \
  -e ELASTICSEARCH_ADDR="elasticsearch.example.com" \
  --restart=always \
  logzio/logzio-es-health
```

## Usage (nagios monitor)
Nagios monitoring implements Nagios native plugin interface.
Which means by exit codes:
```bash
exit 0 # Everything is awesome
exit 1 # Warning!
exit 2 # Critical!!
exit 3 # Unknown
```
It will also print a message that both humans and Nagios loves. Expect something like:
```
WARNING: Cluster status is yellow! | status: yellow
```
The data before the pipeline is for your notifications, and the data after the pipeline is for you to use in nagios performance data.

#### Available monitoring components and usage
```bash
docker exec CONTAINER /root/nagios.sh COMPONENT -c CRITICAL -w WARNING
```

Where COMPONENT is in:
```
initializing_shards             (e.g initializing_shards -w 5 -c 10)
number_of_pending_tasks         (e.g number_of_pending_tasks -w 50 -c 100)
relocating_shards               (e.g relocating_shards -c 10 -w 5)
unassigned_shards               (e.g unassigned_shards -w 1 -c 2)
status                          (e.g -c yellow / -c red -w yellow)
mapping_size                    (e.g -c 4000000 -w 3000000 (this one is tricky, tune it carefully))
```
